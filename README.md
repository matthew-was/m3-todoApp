### TODO List

Create a JSON over HTTP API and a responsive web UI client that enables a single user (no need for account creation etc) to create, edit and delete
todo list items.  The API should be covered by a full suite of tests.

Tech Stack should include but is not limited to:

- Bootstrap
- React
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- PostGres
- KnexJS
- Docker

Executing docker-compose up at the root of the repository should start two dockers containers, one running the 
express app the other the postgres server.
